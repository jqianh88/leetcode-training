    "# Solution/Explanation - Robot Bounded in Circle\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem is more about mathematical proof than coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the location of the robot after one iteration. There are two cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The robot is back to the origin. In this case, it's obvious that the robot will stay at the origin after any number of runs.\n",
    "2. The robot is not at the origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "For case 2, let's consider where the robot is facing after one iteration. The robot starts facing north, and after one iteration, it could face:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. North. Since it's facing the same direction after one iteration, it'll get further and further away from the origin in the next iterations. Therefore, its movement will not be bounded by a circle.\n",
    "2. South. The robot reverses its direction. The distance it traveled in the current movement will be cancelled by the next movement, since they are in opposite directions. Therefore, the robot goes back to the origin every two iterations.\n",
    "3. East. If the robot ends up facing east after the first iteration, it will be facing south after the second iteration, west after the third iteration, and north again after the fourth iteration. The distance it travelled in the north direction cancels that of the south, and the distance it traveled in the east direction cancels that of the west. So, the robot is back to origin after four iterations.\n",
    "4. West. It's the opposite situation as the east, but the result is the same - the robot goes back to the origin.\n",
    "Therefore, we can simulate the robot's movement after one iteration and return true if the robot's coordinate is back to the origin, or it faces a direction that is not north."

    "\n",
    "Naively, we can make a Boolean array holding the presence of the separator at each index, and then iterate through it to find the largest gap. This requires both O(n) auxiliary space and O(n) time for n separators. (Note: n here is the value, not the size, of the input! See pseudo-polynomial).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since we are provided with the indices of separators that are removed, it suggests that the removed separators may be sparse. Therefore, to reduce the space (but not time) complexity of the above approach, we can use a set to store the removed separators. This would use O(|h|) space, where |h| is the size of the input array h, and |h| <= n since you can't remove more separators than the total number of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "To further improve the solution: If we have a sorted array of all removed separators, then we don't need to traverse through 1..n to find the consecutive ones, we can simply go through the sorted array. Sorting the array takes O(|h| * log(|h|)) time, and going through the sorted array to find the largest gap takes O(|h|) time. The auxiliary space required is constant if we modify the input arrays; otherwise O(|h|) is needed to store the sorted values. Note that if the input array h is already sorted, this is a strictly better solution. If not, it will depend on the size of h and the value of n. The lower percentage of the separators removed (i.e., the more sparse the \"removed separators\" are), the more efficient this approach is compared to the previous one.\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution uses the last approach, i.e., sorting and going through the array. This approach is not significantly slower in the worst case but is much faster in many other cases."

    "Your approach tries to distribute jobs by iterating backwards over the jobDifficulty array and assigning jobs to days from the last day (day = d - 1). However, you are not respecting the constraint that you must finish at least one job every day, and you are not ensuring the jobs are distributed in a way that minimizes the difficulty. Specifically:\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrong approach to filling the days: You're starting from the last day and placing jobs there, which is not how the problem is intended to be solved. The goal is to partition the jobs into d days while minimizing the maximum difficulty of the hardest day. You need to try different ways of splitting the jobs.\n",

    "Unnecessary Complexity in total Calculation: You are trying to calculate the total difficulty as you go along, but you're not correctly breaking the jobs into groups per day in a way that minimizes the total difficulty.\n",

    "Issue 2: Not Ensuring Each Day Gets at Least One Job\n",
    "Your loop doesn’t guarantee that each day gets at least one job. In fact, you're only checking the maximum job difficulty for each day individually but not ensuring that each day has at least one job assigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approach to Fix It\n",
    "A better approach is to use Dynamic Programming (DP), where you compute the minimum difficulty of scheduling the jobs across d days while respecting the constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Correct Approach with Dynamic Programming\n",
    "We can define a DP table where dp[i][j] represents the minimum difficulty of scheduling the first i jobs over j days. This way, you can calculate the minimum difficulty by considering the last day’s maximum difficulty and the previous days' difficulties.\n",

    "Base Case: dp[0][0] = 0 (no jobs, no difficulty), and all other cases involving zero jobs or zero days should be set to infinity since it's invalid.\n",

    "\n",
    "The key idea behind this approach is to explore all possible ways of partitioning the list of job difficulties into d partitions, where each partition corresponds to the set of jobs assigned to a single day of work. The difficulty of a single day's work is determined by the maximum difficulty job in that set. The goal is to minimize the sum of these daily difficulties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The DFS function dfs(i, d) works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Base Case: If there is only one day left (d == 1), then we have no choice but to do all remaining jobs on that day. The difficulty for that day would be the maximum difficulty of all remaining jobs starting from index i to the end of the job difficulty list. Thus, it returns the maximum difficulty from the sublist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive Case: If more than one day is left to schedule, the DFS tries each possible index j at which you can end the work for one day and begin another for the next day. For each of these indices, it keeps track of the maximum job difficulty seen so far (maxInDivision) and uses it as the difficulty of the current day.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then calls itself recursively for the remaining portion of the list, starting at the next index j + 1, and for one fewer day d - 1. The function returns the minimum of all these values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimize Total Difficulty: For each step or division, the total difficulty is calculated as the maximum difficulty of the current partition (current day's work) plus the minimum difficulty of the remaining days (obtained through recursive calls). We need to minimize this value, which represents the cumulative difficulty of scheduling the jobs up to the d-th day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memoization (Python Only): In the Python implementation, the @lru_cache decorator is used to add memoization to the dfs function to speed up the process by storing and reusing the results of previous calls with the same parameters (i, d). Without memoization, the DFS would redundantly compute the results for the same subproblems over and over, leading to an exponential time complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the DFS approach tries to build an optimal schedule by breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems and combining the results to form a global solution. The DFS explores all possible partitions and keeps track of the minimum total difficulty encountered across all explored paths.\n",

The purpose of the function is to merge these two lists into a single list that is also sorted in non-decreasing order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the function works:\n",
    "\n",
    "A new dummy node, with an arbitrary value of 0, is created to act as a placeholder to start the merged list. This dummy node doesn't hold any actual data from the input lists; its main purpose is to provide a starting point to build the merged list without having to handle special edge cases for the head of the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable cur is assigned to the dummy node. This variable will be used to keep track of the current position in the merged list as we construct it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function enters a while loop, which continues to iterate as long as there are elements in both l1 and l2. On each iteration of the loop:\n",
    "\n",
    "The values of the current nodes of l1 and l2 are compared.\n",
    "If the value of the current node in l1 is less than the value in l2, the next pointer of cur is set to the current node in l1, and the l1 pointer is advanced to its next node.\n",
    "Otherwise, the next pointer of cur is set to the current node in l2, and the l2 pointer is advanced to its next node.\n",
    "The cur pointer is then advanced to the next node that was just added to the merged list.\n",
    "After the loop exits, one of the two lists may still have elements left because the loop only continues while both lists have elements. The line cur.next = l1 or l2 ensures that the remaining elements from either l1 or l2 are appended to the end of the merged list. This is efficient because the lists are already sorted, so we can simply link the remaining part of the non-empty list to the merged list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the function returns dummy.next, which points to the head of the newly merged list. The dummy node itself is skipped because it was only a placeholder to simplify the merging process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The returned head of the node effectively points to a list that contains all the elements of l1 and l2, merged together in a sorted manner."

    "We track the minimum degree found for any connected trio and return it at the end. If no connected trio is found, we return -1.\n",
    "Time Complexity:\n",

However, the algorithm's time complexity may be high for larger graphs, but it is a straightforward and correct solution. Further optimizations could involve reducing redundant checks or using more advanced graph traversal techniques."

    " processes and sorts a given list of log file strings. Here are the steps carried out by the function:\n",
    "\n",
    "The function initializes two empty lists: alphas and nums. These will be used to store the alphanumeric (letter) logs and the numeric logs, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then iterates through each log entry in the provided logs list.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each log, it splits the string into two parts using the first space encountered. The part before the space is considered the identifier (ident), and the part after the space is considered the content (cont).\n",
    "\n",
    "It then checks the first character of the cont to determine if it is a letter or a digit using the isalpha method.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the first character is a letter, the tuple (cont, ident) is appended to the alphas list. This tuple pairs the content with the identifier, which will make sorting by content easier while still preserving the identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the first character is not a letter (hence a digit), the tuple (cont, ident) is appended to the nums list.\n",
    "\n",
    "After all logs have been processed, the alphas list is sorted lexicographically (alphabetically by content then by identifier if there's a tie) because it contains tuples with the content as the first element.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function then concatenates the sorted alphas list with the nums list (which remains unsorted as per requirements) since numeric logs should remain in the original order they were received.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the function returns a new list of formatted logs, where each log is reconstructed by combining the identifier and the content with a space in between. It does so for all tuples in the concatenated list alphas + nums.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output list will thus have all the letter logs in sorted order (by content, then by identifier in case of ties) followed by all the numeric logs in their original order. This sorting logic follows the guidelines that are commonly given for this type of log file processing challenge.\n"
