    "\n",
    "The elements in the tree are unique, so we can construct a mapping from the value to the index in the inorder array.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the given preorder array, the first element represents the root of the binary tree. Using this value, its index is located in the inorder array. The elements to the left of this index in the inorder array represent the left subtree, and the elements to the right represent the right subtree. The same steps are then repeated for the left and right subtrees respectively (recursively).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the solution step by step:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a value-to-index map for inorder traversal: We create a dictionary to store the index of each value in the inorder traversal. This allows us to quickly find the position of the root in the inorder array, which is crucial for determining the sizes of left and right subtrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define a recursive helper function: We create a helper function that takes the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "preorder_start and preorder_end: the range of indices in the preorder array we're currently considering.\n",
    "inorder_start and inorder_end: the range of indices in the inorder array we're currently considering.\n",
    "Base case: If the start index is greater than the end index for either array, we return None, as this represents an empty subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identify the root: The first element in the current preorder range is always the root of the current subtree.\n",
    "\n",
    "Find the root in inorder traversal: Use the value-to-index map to quickly locate the root's position in the inorder array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculate sizes of left and right subtrees: The number of elements to the left of the root in the inorder array is the size of the left subtree. The remaining elements form the right subtree.\n",

    "Return the constructed node: Create a new TreeNode with the root value and attach the left and right subtrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "This recursive approach efficiently reconstructs the binary tree by dividing the problem into smaller subproblems for each subtree. The use of the value-to-index map allows for O(1) lookup of root positions in the inorder array, resulting in an overall time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.\n",

    "# Explanation of Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind this problem is to use the property of Binary Search Trees.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a quick recap, a Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of binary tree where for any given node with value a, the values in its left subtree are all less than a and the values in its right subtree are all greather than a.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree on the left is a BST because every node holds this property whereas the right tree is not a BST because there is a 2 on the right subtree of the the node with value 3. Since 2 < 3, the property that the values on the rightside is greater than the current node does not hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "Original Problem\n",
    "Trees are naturally recursive data structures and as such we will use recursion to find our answer. For Binary Search Trees specifically, we often break down each recursive call into cases. The reason we do this is because for every node we can decide whether to traverse down the left subtree or right subtree based on the value of the current node.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the Lowest Common Ancestor of two nodes in a BST, we break our search into 3 common cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "If nodes p and q are on the left of the current node, then continue search the left side\n",
    "If nodes p and q are on the right of the current node, then continue search the right side\n",
    "If nodes p and q are split (one is on the left, the other is on the right), then we can return the current node as the LCA.\n",
    "Note that there is a special case when either p == cur.val or q == cur.val, since we have defined that a node can be its own descedent, this falls in case 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Complexity\n",
    "Since we don't need to traverse the entire tree for our search and on each level we only visit a single node, the final time complexity is O(h) where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case, the tree is not balanced and h is n.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Space Complexity\n",
    "If we count stack memory as space usage, then our space complexity is O(h) where h is the height of the tree because in the worst case we have a line graph where nodes p and q are at the end, which leads to O(n) stack memory."

    "The serialize function takes the root of a binary tree and turns it into a string representation. The nodes are traversed in depth first search (DFS) order (visiting a node, then its left child, then its right child). To serialize the root of the current binary tree, we'll first append the value at each node to the string, with 'x' appended for null nodes ,then add the serialization for the subtrees at the left and right children (in that order since this is a DFS) by using the serialize function. The 'x' is used to allow us to differentiate leaf nodes from non-leaf nodes when deserializing. This final string is then returned by the serialize function.\n",

We can accomplish this by splitting the string into tokens and reading them in the original DFS order. If it encounters a node value, it instantiates a new node with the same value.

After that, it appends \"->\" and the value of the current leaf node (converted to a string using str(root.val)), creating the full path. The resulting string is then added to the result list, which keeps track of all paths found in the tree.\n",

This is used instead of append because append modifies the original list in-place, while using + creates a new list. This is important in the context of a recursive function like dfs, as each recursive call should have its own copy of the path list. If we used append, it would add the current node to the same path list used by all recursive calls, which would lead to incorrect results since every path would end up with all nodes visited during the entire search instead of only those in the current branch.\n",

This is not space-efficient because creating a new list involves allocating new space in memory and copying over each element. A more efficient method is to use a single list, path, and push and pop according to the call stack. Feel free to revisit the recursion section if you need a review of the call stack.\n",

    "Instead:\n",
    "The code uses pop after appending to the path list in a depth-first search (DFS) implementation within a tree structure to backtrack. In DFS, we traverse a path from the root to a leaf node. When we reach a leaf node, we record the path we've taken.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using pop is part of the backtracking process, which is essential in DFS. When we reach a leaf node and have processed it (i.e., stored the path that led to it), we need to go back up the tree to explore other paths. This is done by removing the last node we visited from the current path, so our path list reflects the actual path as we return up the tree. Without this step, the path would just keep growing with all nodes we have visited and would not correctly represent the individual paths from root to each leaf.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, push (or add) adds the current node's value to the path as we go deeper into the tree, and pop (or remove) removes the node's value from the path as we backtrack, allowing us to explore new paths from earlier junctions within the tree. This technique ensures we use only the necessary amount of space to store the path at any given point in the recursion, making it more space-efficient as the same list is reused for all paths instead of creating a new list for each path."

    "- The \"height of the tree\" is the number of decisions that we need to make to reach a leaf node, starting counting from zero. For 2-letter words, we make decisions at two levels: first we add one letter, then we add the second letter. Hence, the height of our tree is 2.\n",
    "- To calculate the total number of nodes in the tree using the provided formula, we raise the number of children per node to the power of the height of the tree.\n",
    "- Number of children per node = 2 (either 'a' or 'b') Height of the tree = 2 (because we are creating 2-letter words). Therefore, the total number of nodes in the tree is 2^2, which is 4.\n",
    "- However, it is important to note that the formula \"number of children of each node ^ height of the tree\" actually defines the number of leaf nodes, not the total number of nodes in a fully balanced binary tree. This is because each decision point (except for the root) is a child of a previous decision, so the upper levels of nodes have fewer nodes due to how binary trees work.\n",
    "- For a binary tree, the total number of nodes is the sum of the nodes at each level, which is given by the formula: 2^0 + 2^1 + 2^2 + ... + 2^height for a perfect binary tree.\n",
    "In our 2-letter word example, the total number of nodes (including intermediate nodes and leaf nodes) would be:\n",
    "- Level 0 (Root): 2^0 = 1 Level 1: 2^1 = 2 Level 2 (Leaf nodes): 2^2 = 4\n",
    "Adding them up: 1 + 2 + 4 = 7\n",
    "- So there are 7 nodes in total, including the root, intermediate nodes, and leaf nodes, for a tree that represents all 2-letter words using 'a' and 'b'.\n",
    "\n",

    "# Explanation of General ALl Permutations\n",
    "\n",
    "Permutation is very similar to combination except the same element can NOT be used more than once. For example, if we had picked a for our first letter, we can not use it again for other letters for the same permutation. Here's the state-space tree:\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional states\n",
    "This is where we need an additional state to keep track of the letters we have already used. We will introduct a used list to record which letters are already used. used[i] == true means ith letter in the origin list has been used. This variable is passed to the recursive calls to skip the used letters when we branch out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Revert additional states\n",
    "Note that in the Generate All Parentheses problem, the additional states openCount and closeCount are copied and in the recurive calls. The used variable, however, is passed by reference in a recursive call. Therefore we have to \"undo\" the update much like how we undo the update in path variable by popping the last element after the recursive call.\n",
    "\n",
    "Applying our template\n",
    "```\n",
    "function dfs(start_index, path, [...additional states]):\n",
    "  if is_leaf(start_index):\n",
    "    report(path)\n",
    "    return\n",
    "  for child in get_edges(start_index, [...additional states]):\n",
    "    # prune if needed\n",
    "    if not is_valid(child):\n",
    "      continue\n",
    "    path.add(child)\n",
    "    update(start_index)\n",
    "    if additional states:\n",
    "      update(...additional states)\n",

    "\n",
    "- is_leaf: start_index == letter.length\n",
    "- get_edges: each letter in the input\n",
    "- is_valid: if a letter is used used[i] == True, then we skip it\n",
    "- ...additional states: used to record which letter is used in the current path\n",
    "- revert(...additional states): set used[i] = False\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity\n",
    "We have n letters to choose in the first level, n - 1 choices in the second level and so on therefore the number of strings we generate is n * (n - 1) * (n - 2) * ... * 1, or O(n!) (see math basics if you need a refresher on factorial). Since each string has length n, generating all the strings requires O(n * n!) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity\n",
    "The total space complexity is given by the amount of space required by the strings we're constructing. Like the time complexity, the space complexity is also O(n * n!)."

It means saving the previous function call result in a dictionary and reading from it when we do the exact same call again. And no I didn't spell it wrong.

    "\n",
    "What to memoize\n",
    "Think about the duplicate subtrees, what attribute(s) do they share? In the Fibonacci example, the duplicate subtrees have the same n value. Usually, the key to the memo is the start_index or any additional states that may appear multiple times during the recursion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time Complexity Analysis\n",
    "The benefit of memoization is that we store the obtained information in our memo so that we can access it in constant time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time to do backtracking is proportional to the number of nodes in the state-space tree. However, with memoization, we avoid duplicate subtrees (e.g. the red subtrees in the 2nd and 3rd slides). Therefore, the actual number of nodes visited is proportional to the size of the memo array.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the above Fibonacci example, the size of the memo is O(n) (space complexity) and for each node we do O(1) work to combine the results from child recursive calls. Therefore the overall time complexity is O(n).\n",
    "\n",
    "Memoization is particularly useful for combinatorial problems that have large repeated state-space tree branches. We will see that in the next module."
