    "# Optimizing Box Weights\n",
    "To solve this problem efficiently, we need to divide the given array arr of item weights into two subsets, A and B, satisfying the following conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "The intersection of subsets A and B is empty, i.e., A and B do not overlap.\n",
    "The union of A and B is equal to the original array arr.\n",
    "The number of elements in subset A should be minimal.\n",
    "The sum of A's weights must be strictly greater than the sum of B's weights.\n",
    "If more than one valid subset A exists, return the subset with the maximal total weight.\n",
    "Approach:\n",
    "Sort the array:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, sort the array in decreasing order of weights. This ensures that when we start adding items to subset A, we always pick the heaviest items first, which helps in satisfying the condition of having the sum of A’s weights greater than B’s weights with minimal elements in A.\n",
    "Greedy Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by adding the largest items from the array to subset A.\n",
    "Keep track of the sum of weights in A (sumA) and the sum of weights in B (sumB).\n",
    "Continue adding items to A until the sum of A's weights is greater than the sum of B’s weights.\n",
    "The minimal number of items will naturally be selected because we always add the largest available items first.\n",
    "Return the result:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have found subset A, we return it in increasing order, as required by the problem.\n",
    "Detailed Plan:\n",
    "Sort the Array: Sort the items in decreasing order so that we can greedily pick the heaviest items for subset A first.\n",
    "Divide the Array: Start adding items to subset A and keep track of their sum until it exceeds the sum of the remaining items (which would be subset B).\n",
    "Return the Result: Once the condition is met, return the items in subset A in increasing order.\n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation of the Code:\n",
    "Sorting the Array: We start by sorting the array in descending order. This makes it easy to add the largest items to subset A first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Greedy Selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "We maintain two variables: sumA (the sum of items in subset A) and sumB (the sum of the remaining items, initially equal to the sum of the entire array).\n",
    "We iterate through the sorted array, adding items to subset A. After adding an item, we update the sums of sumA and sumB. The loop stops when sumA exceeds sumB.\n",
    "Return Subset A:\n",
    "\n",
    "After the loop ends, subset A contains the minimal set of items where sumA > sumB. Finally, we return subset A in increasing order, as requested.\n",
    "Time Complexity:\n",
    "Sorting: Sorting the array takes \n",
    "\n",
    "O(nlogn), where \n",
    "n is the number of elements in the array.\n",
    "## Greedy Selection: We iterate over the array once, which takes \n",
    "O(n) time.\n",
    "Sorting the result: The final sorting of the subset A takes \n",
    "O(klogk), where \n",
    "k is the number of elements in subset A. In the worst case, \n",
    "k=n.\n",
    "Thus, the overall time complexity is:\n",
    "O(nlogn+nlogn)=O(nlogn)\n",
    "Space Complexity:\n",
    "Auxiliary Space: The space complexity is \n",
    "\n",
    "O(n) due to the space used for storing the sorted array and subset A.\n",
    "Thus, the space complexity is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "O(n)\n",
    "Conclusion:\n",
    "This solution uses a greedy approach with sorting to ensure that we select the smallest subset A with the maximum sum of weights greater than the sum of B's weights. The complexity is efficient enough for the problem constraints and meets the requirements of minimal elements in A and maximal total weight."
